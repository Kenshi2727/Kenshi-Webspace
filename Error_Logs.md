## 2. `<a>` Nested Inside `<a>` Hydration Error

**Date:**  2025-10-18 
<br>
**Environment:**  Prouction - React, likely during client hydration after SSR
<br>
**Error Message:** 

```bash
In HTML, <a> cannot be a descendant of <a>.
This will cause a hydration error.

<a> cannot contain a nested <a>.
See this log for the ancestor stack trace.

```

**Cause:**  

The rendered component structure contains nested anchor (`<a>`) tags â€” an outer <LinkWithRef> wrapping the entire card and an inner <LinkWithRef> (or `<a>`) inside it.
This creates invalid HTML (`<a><a>...</a></a>`), which browsers auto-correct differently during server-side rendering, leading to a hydration mismatch in React.

Example pattern causing the issue:

```jsx
<LinkWithRef to="/articles/0">
  <a href="/articles/0">
    ...
    <LinkWithRef to="/articles/0">
      <a href="/articles/0">Read more</a>
    </LinkWithRef>
  </a>
</LinkWithRef>

```

**Solution:**  
Ensure that no `<a> or <Link>` component is nested within another.
You can fix this by replacing the inner link with a non-anchor element (`<span> or <div>`) or by keeping only one LinkWithRef wrapper per card.

Corrected example:

```jsx
<LinkWithRef to="/articles/0">
  <Card>
    <CardContent>
      <motion.h3>{title}</motion.h3>
      <span className="text-indigo-600 hover:underline text-sm">
        Read more
      </span>
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
</LinkWithRef>

```
